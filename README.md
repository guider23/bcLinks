# BC LINKS – June 2025 Update

Here's what I've been cooking behind the scenes — BC LINKS just got a massive glow-up. Built solo, fueled by creativity and focus.

---

### Modular Alias System  
Every tool now gets its own readable `bc://alias`, internally mapped to a secure unique hash.  
- Easy to remember  
- Protected  
- Aesthetically powerful  

---

### Live Tool Previews  
No reloads, no clunky navigation — just smooth iframe modals for each tool.  
- Works flawlessly on both desktop and mobile  
- Ideal for instant previews and embedded utilities  

---

### Code-Gated Access  
Secret tools, hidden URLs, and one-time drop codes — all possible now.  
- Access is granted only if the correct hash-linked code is entered  
- Built using pure static JSON + JavaScript logic  

---

### Mobile Orientation Lock  
Rotate to landscape? The site blurs out and warns you.  
- Keeps the UI clean and controlled  
- Encourages proper interaction for mobile users

> More updates are on the way: Supabase integration, real-time admin panel, QR alias drops, and stat tracking system for every link.  
> Stay tuned. bC Works is just getting started.
